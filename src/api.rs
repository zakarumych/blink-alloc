/// and potentially no-op deallocation.

/// Typically deallocation is either no-op or processed only if deallocating
/// the very last allocated memory block.
/// The [`reset`][BlinkAllocator::reset]
/// method deallocates all memory allocated from this instance at once.
///
/// # Safety
///
/// Draws most requirements from [`Allocator`] super-trait.
/// The [`reset`][BlinkAllocator::reset] method
/// may invalidate currently allocated memory if allocator is not cloneable.

    /// and so cannot be called while collection types reference it.

    /// for, say, [`Vec`] and later then call `reset` safely.
